Flu And Coronavirus Simulator (FACS)
=================================

FACS is an agent-based modelling code that models the spread of flu and coronaviruses in local regions. Up to now, we have used it to model the spread of Covid-19 in a range of London boroughs.

The code can be repurposed to model other regions, and its current (sequential) implementation should be able to run up to 500,000 households within a reasonable time frame. It also supports vaccination programmes, track and trace and mutated versions of the virus.

What sets FACS apart from many other codes is that we have a partially automated location extraction approach from OpenStreetMaps data (the scripts reside at https://www.github.com/djgroen/covid19-preprocess), that we resolve a wide range of different location types (e.g., supermarkets, offices, parks, schools, leisure locations and hospitals) and that we have a specific algorithm for modeling infections *within* these locations, taking into account the physical size of each location.

We are currently finalizing a first journal paper about FACS, and will link to it from this page once it has become available.

Quick installation notes
========================

To install FACS, simply clone the GitHub repository, and ensure the dependencies are met.
 
.. code:: console

          git clone https://github.com/djgroen/facs.git


These dependencies are:

* PyYaml
* numpy
* pandas

How to run the code
-------------------
To run a simple simulation of a basic test dataset, type:
`python3 run.py --location=test --transition_scenario=extend-lockdown --transition_mode=1 --output_dir=.`

To run a simulation of the Borough of Brent, type:
`python3 run.py --location=brent --transition_scenario=extend-lockdown --transition_mode=1 --output_dir=.`

Outputs are written as CSV files in the output\_dir. E.g. for the test run you will get:
covid\_out\_infections.csv
test-extend-lockdown-62.csv

There is a hardcoded lockdown in run.py which is representative for the UK. This can be disabled by selecting the transition scenario "no-measures".

We also included a simple plotting script. This can be called e.g. as follows:
`python3 PlotSEIR.py test-extend-lockdown-62.csv test`
